Projects
======

1. Hospital Survey System.[UPMC Hillman Cancer Center]
Developed a hospital survey platform from scratch to production using MVC architecture, enabling researchers to
create and manage surveys efficiently.
â€¢ Built an interactive survey editor with React Hooks, TypeScript, and Ant Design, implementing a drag-and-drop feature
that simplified survey customization.
â€¢ Designed and implemented a scalable backend using Express.js, establishing RESTful APIs and CRUD operations to handle
survey data, responses, and administrative controls seamlessly.
â€¢ Optimized MongoDB database schemas by implementing efficient indexing strategies, improving query performance by 40%
and ensuring scalable data storage for large-scale survey responses.

2. Switch System Developing. [Cisco-Inspur]
Developed authentication module for switch system using Spring Boot + JPA, enabling efficient user verification.
â€¢ Implemented asynchronous processing for receiving usersâ€™ information, leveraging @Async in Spring Boot, which
improved authentication efficiency by 30% by reducing request handling time.
â€¢ Designed and optimized MAC address verification for voice phone authentication using regular expressions,
ensuring accurate user matching and reducing authentication errors. Managed project dependencies using Spring Beans
for efficient object lifecycle control.
â€¢ Enhanced system scalability by implementing pagination for MAC address retrieval across controller, service,
and repository layers, significantly optimizing data retrieval performance and reducing query load for large datasets
